## Load a LIGGGHTS dump of particles in Matlab

Since the file is not homogeneous, a specialized loading routine is required. This file accepts any combination of variables properties per particles. See in the example how to get these values from the dump in a fast and robust manner (independent of the number of variables or their order).
